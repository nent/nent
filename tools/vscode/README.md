## What is NENT?

NENT is a library of functional elements (web components) that extend HTML with web application features without a complex build-process. No JavaScript required.

### Features:

* Single-page URL Routing
* Guided Navigation
* Presentations
* Declarative Actions
* Audio Orchestration
* Video Synchronization

The best way to see what these elements in action, is to take a look at the documentation demo. The installable app is built using these elements in a single HTML file (with child-routes and partials lazy-loaded, as-needed).
