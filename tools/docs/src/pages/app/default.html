  <h1>App Elements</h1>
  <p class="lead">These elements add native-app functionality to your HTML page.
  </p>
  <p>
    The elements in this namespace are designed to provide functionality
    typically available only to native apps.
    As the browser's functionality expands, watch this space for new elements
    that take advantage of them for users of NENT.</p>
  <h2>Coming Soon!</h2>
  <p>
    In the near future, we will publish elements for creating installable
    applications with
    features like offline-mode, pre-cached routes and low-code service-workers.
  </p>
  <h3>App Elements</h3>
  <p>Currently, we support system-themes detection and control (dark or
    light-mode), native-sharing and the
    capture of application-wide analytics.
