# N-VIEW-PROMPT

The [\<n-view-prompt\>](/components/n-view-prompt) element represents a specialized child-route that can force a prompt before the parent route is displayed.

> [\<n-view-prompt\>](/components/n-view-prompt) can be used to capture data, agree to terms or anything else the parent route may need.

They are used to create presentations, wizards, input workflows, or step-by-step instructions.


### How it works

When the parent [\<n-view\>](/components/n-view)'s route is activated, before rendering, it:

1. Lists all direct-child [\<n-view-prompt\>](/components/n-view-prompt) items, one at a time in sequence.
2. Finds the first unvisited route respecting the **'visit'** requirement or [**'when'** predicate](/expression), if present.

   - **If found**: It pushes the page state to its URL, thus activated the child route.
   - **Otherwise**: The [\<n-view\>](/components/n-view) is satisfied and can now render its own contents.

## Samples

The following are some examples to demonstrate how you can combine the settings to create robust workflows.

### Present Once

This route will be activated once for each new visit to the page. (Visit 'once' is the default behavior, so it can be omitted.)

```html
<n-view-prompt path='/accept-terms' 
  page-title='Consent' 
  visit='once'>
  ...
</n-view-prompt>
```

> By default, the visit strategy is 'once'. In this case, the visit is stored in the local storage. Any subsequent visits to this page with the same browser won't see it again.

### Present Each Visit

This route will be activated once for each new session visit to the page.

```html
<n-view-prompt
  path='/accept-terms'
  page-title='Consent'
  visit='always'
>
  ...
</n-view-prompt>
```

> For **'always'**, the visit is stored in local-session which is destroyed when the browser tab is closed, but retained while on the site.

### Collect Required Data

This route will be activated if a value for 'consent' was not found in local-storage[^1].

```html
<n-view-prompt
  path='/accept-terms'
  page-title='Consent'
  when='!{{storage:consent}}'
>
  ...
</n-view-prompt>
```

> **Important**: If a value for `{{storage:consent}}` is not set in this route's somehow, the user cannot get to the parent page.

This data can be set manually or using our specialized declarative elements to update data. See [actions](/actions) for more info.

[^1]: Check out the [data system](/data) for info to use external data.

### Optional

This route will be activated only through navigation. This is helpful for opt-in presentations, modals or other action-based content.

```html
<n-view-prompt
  path='/learn-more'
  page-title='Watch a video'
  visit='optional'
>
  ...
</n-view-prompt>
```

### Routing & Guided Navigation

This evaluation has to take place before the route is activated as the underlying data can change in the previous Do elements. If the element is deemed unnecessary (the predicate returns false), the element marks itself ‘complete’ and returns control to the parent view, without revealing its contents.

## Usage

### Basic

Much like its parent, [\<n-view\>](/components/n-view), basic routing information is required.

```html
<n-view ...>
  <n-view-prompt
    path='<sub-path>'
    page-title='<route title>'
    visit='always|once|optional'
    when='<expression predicate>'
    src='<remote html with route sand children>'
    content-src='<remote content html>'
    transition='<animation-enter>'
    scroll-top-offset=''
  >
    ...
  </n-view-prompt>
  ...
</n-view>
```

> The **when** attribute is a data expression that overrides the **visit** strategy. It is a predicate that produces a boolean result. **true: visit=always** false: visit=optional
