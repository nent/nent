# N-VIEW

The View element is a child element for the `<n-view>` element for adding a page route. It is a container element that displays its inner HTML for a given route or sub-route. This provides a declarative mechanism for in-page content/component routing by URL.

## Extensions

* [Elements](/components/n-view/elements)
* [Data](/components/n-view/data)


> The view element uses the display property in CSS to hide and show based on the route. It is important that any class added does not override this

### Child Views & Routing

Views can hold any HTML, including View elements. This implicitly creates child routes below the path configured for this View. This View will enforce the routing rule, by inserting its path in the child-views path property (This should be done in a way that accounts for the parent path being included in the child path attribute)

```html
<n-views>
  <n-view path='/'>
  ...
  </n-view>
  <n-view path='/about'>
    <n-view path='/location'>
    ...
    </n-view>
  </n-view>
</n-views>
```

### View Prompts

The contained HTML is parsed before rendering and special handling is given if any child elements are [\<n-view-prompt\>](/components/n-view-prompt) elements. Before rendering its HTML, this element iterates the collection and evaluates their conditions (_when_ attribute) looking for the first [\<n-view-prompt\>](/components/n-view-prompt) that should be displayed, using the order they are declared. If and when a non-visited [\<n-view-prompt\>](/components/n-view-prompt) is found, its route is activated and subsequently marked as visited.

[\<n-view-prompt\>](/components/n-view-prompt) elements each have their own **visit** strategies, but each of them need only return to their parent URL when completed. The parent performs the above evaluation until each child [\<n-view-prompt\>](/components/n-view-prompt) element has been visited or is excluded by its rule (_when_ attribute).

At that point, the inner HTML content is finally revealed. Using this convention, you can declaratively create a workflow of pages that must be visited to reach a destination.

### Basic

```html
<n-views>
  <n-view path='/'
    page-title='Home'
    transition='fade-in'>
    ...

  <n-view path='/about'
    page-title='About Us'
    scroll-top-offset='20'>

## Slots

| Slot        | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"content"` | The content route is rendered only when the route           matches EXACTLY. Note: This HTML is removed when the           route changes.                         |
| `"default"` | The default slot is rendered when this route is           activated, visible by default to all routes matching           the route URL (typically, child routes). |
