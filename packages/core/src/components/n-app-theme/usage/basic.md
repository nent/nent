Add this tag somewhere close to the top of the application to auto-adjust the theme class
based on the user's preferences.

Use it in conjunction with the [\<n-app-theme-switch\>](/components/n-app-theme-switch) element
to give users control of which theme should be applied.

```html
<n-app>
  <n-app-theme>    
  </n-app-theme>
</n-app>
```
