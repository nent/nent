# N-AUDIO-ACTION-SOUND-LOAD

The [\<n-audio-action-sound-load\>](/components/n-audio-action-sound-load) element represents audio files and play behaviors. They are all sent to the global-audio player to pre-load or play when the route is active. The player manages them according to their settings.

> See the [audio](/audio) systems documentation for more information.

## Usage

```html
<n-view-prompt>
  <n-audio-action-sound-load 
    mode='queue|play|load' 
    track-id='<unique-id>' 
    src='<url>' 
    discard='route|next|none' 
    track>
  </n-audio-action-sound-load>
</n-view-prompt>
```

### Simple

```html
<n-view-prompt>
  <n-audio-action-sound-load 
    track-id='<unique-id>' 
    src='<url>'>
  </n-audio-action-sound-load>
</n-view-prompt>
```

## Timed

For timed audio, the audio is sent upfront for pre-loading. Then at the given time, a separate [\<n-audio-action-sound\>](/components/n-audio-action-sound) event is dispatched to play it at a given time. This way, the audio is likely to play on time without any buffering.

The following demonstrates how to load a track, and wait 10 seconds until it plays. It's important to remember this time can be paused by the user, so it could be any amount of time if a video is playing.

```html
<n-view-prompt>
  <n-audio-action-sound-load 
    track-id='audio1' 
    src='<url>'>
  </n-audio-action-sound-load>
  <n-action-activator 
    activate='AtTime' 
    time='10'>
    <n-audio-action-sound 
      command='start' 
      track-id='audio1'>
    </n-audio-action-sound>
  </n-action-activator>
</n-view-prompt>
```

### Mode

* **queue**: (default) plays after the previous audio is complete or when it's requested.
* **play**: stop any playing audio and play now, buffering be-damned.
* **wait**: wait for action before playing, any currently playing audio continues.

#### Discard

* **video**: when any video plays (default for sound)
* **state**: state changes
* **event**: wait for a stop event (or any other activation)
* **none**: loop until stopped or updated by new state (default for music)

#### Track

If audio has replay set to true, re-entry to the originating state will re-activate the audio if the previous audio has been deactivated. The default is false.
