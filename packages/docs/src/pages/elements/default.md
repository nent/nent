## How it works

The [\<n-elements\>](/components/n-elements) element extends the functionality of other elements by introducing an attribute-based convention that updates any element accordingly.

It also adds an HTML Element modifying Action Listener to enable time-based or event-based changes to HTML.

## Install Extension

```html
<n-elements></n-elements>
```
