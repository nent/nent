  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  <p>
    <b class="brand">nent</b> is a set of custom HTML elements (web
    components)
    to enrich static HTML files with application features. Our focus is on
    creating experiential websites with less scripting and no build-process.

  <h2>What it isn't.</h2>
  <p>
    <b class="brand">nent</b> functional elements add functionality, NOT
    design.
    These elements work <em>with</em> your design. Since it is HTML, you can
    always use it with any framework, element library or UI kit you want.

  <h2>Low-Code, No Framework Needed</h2>
  <p> The elements bring application functionality to HTML with one script
    reference and no code or build-process required. </p>
