  <h1>Sounds</h1>
  <p class="lead">This page has on-demand sounds configured to play when buttons
    are clicked. </p>
  <h2>Add sound-effects or voice-overs declaratively</h2>
  <p> Sounds are a little different than music. We don't loop sounds and they
    need to play on-demand. There are ways to trigger them, but this page
    attaches them to a button. </p>
  <h3>First: Preload</h3>
  <p> To get the timing perfect, we have to pre-load all sounds for a route
    using the <a href="/components/n-audio-action-sound-load">
      <b>&lt;n-audio-action-sound-load&gt;</b>
    </a> element. The default mode for sounds is load. This gets the audio
    ready to play and waits for the start command. </p>

    <script type="text/markdown">
      ```html
      <n-audio-action-sound-load
        track-id="buzz"
        src="/assets/buzzer.wav"
        discard="none">
      </n-audio-action-sound-load>
      ```
      > We set the discard to **none** to tell the player not to discard
      > the sound after it has played, so it can be played again.
    </script>
  </n-content-markdown>
  <h3 class="mt-3">Then: Activate</h3>
  <p> We play the sound by sending an <a href="/actions">action </a> with the start
    command. We can use the <a href="/components/n-action-activator">
      <b>&lt;n-action-activator&gt;</b>
    </a> element and special <a href="/components/n-audio-action-sound">
      <b>&lt;n-audio-action-sound&gt;</b>
    </a> elements with the command, and track-id. </p>
